# Data sources

We collect evidence from various data sources \(e.g. Reactome, SLAPenrich, PROGENy\) and combine similar data sources into categories called Data types \(e.g. Affected pathways\) to allow for target identification and prioritisation using our Open Targets Platform. We list our current data types and their data sources below. Note that data from an individual source can contribute to different Data types, e.g. data from EVA is observed in two data types, Genetic associations and Somatic mutations.
