# Data sources

We collect evidence from various data sources \(e.g. Reactome, SLAPenrich, PROGENy\) to allow for target identification and prioritisation using the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/). We group similar data sources into categories called Data types \(e.g. Affected pathways for Reactome, SLAPenrich and PROGENy\).

These are the current data types.

* [Genetic associations](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/genetic-associations)
* [Somatic mutations](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/somatic-mutations)
* [Drugs](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/drugs)
* [Affected pathways](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/affected-pathways)
* [RNA expression](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/rna-expression)
* [Text mining](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/text-mining)
* [Animal models](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/animal-models)

{% tab title="Note" %}
The evidence from an individual data source can contribute to different data types, e.g. data from EVA is used as evidence for both Genetic associations and Somatic mutations, depending on whether the evidence is a germline variant or somatic mutation, respectively.
