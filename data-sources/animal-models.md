# Animal models

Model organisms are a valuable source for the characterisation and identification of disease-gene associations, especially when the molecular basis and/or function of the candidate target are unknown. We use the data on animal models from MGI:

## PhenoDigm

The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [PhenoDigm](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/phenodigm) database provides evidence on associations of targets and disease. It uses a semantic approach to map between clinical features observed in humans and mouse phenotype annotations. The phenotypic effects in mice are then mapped to phenotypes associated with human diseases, and matches are identified and scored.

## MGI

The [Mouse Genome Informatics](http://www.informatics.jax.org) \(MGI\) Consortium is the key community database for the laboratory mouse. It provides genetic, genomic and biological reference data sets related to mouse genes, gene functions, phenotypes and disease models with an increasing emphasis on the association of these data to human biology and disease.
