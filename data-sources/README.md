#### The data sources for target-disease associations

We provide details of the evidence \(e.g. UniProt\) used for all the associations we have identified. Check our[Data Sources](http://www.targetvalidation.org/data-sources)to find out which evidence we have used in our computational analyses.

If you start your search with a disease, you can go to the evidence page by clicking on the cells in the table. If you would rather search for a gene, you get to the evidence page by clicking on the bubbles \(Bubble view\), the cells in the table \(Table view\) or the nodes in the tree \(Tree view\).

The evidence page shows a flower, where each petal represents one data source, e.g. Genetics, Somatic mutations. If the petal representing somatic mutation for example is coloured in dark blue, this means the association based on somatic mutations is strong. In this page, we also display the detailed information for each evidence divided in sections or panels.
