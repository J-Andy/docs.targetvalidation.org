# Tutorials

Here we include a list of tutorials for programmatic access of the Open Targets Platform data.

Some of these tutorials are to be used with our Python client, whereas others are for direct access from the Open Targets Platform REST-API.

If you want to suggest new tutorials or new use cases for our REST-API or Python client, please [email us](mailto:support@targevalidation.org).
