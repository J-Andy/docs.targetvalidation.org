# Introduction

The [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org) is a comprehensive and robust data integration for access and visualisation of drug targets associated with diseases. It brings together multiple data types and implements a scoring framework on the target-disease associations aiming at assisting users to identify and prioritise drug targets for further investigation.
