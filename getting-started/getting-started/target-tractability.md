# Target tractability

Target tractability is the confidence that you can identify a modulator that interacts with your target of interest, and can elicit a desired biological effect. 

The assessment of target tractability allows you to exploit target details, such as whether there is a binding site in the protein that can be used for small molecule binding, or an accessible epitope for antibody based therapy. This can assist in target prioritisation, drug target inclusion in discovery pipelines and selection of therapeutic modalities that are most likely to succeed.

Another advantage of tractability data is that it allows you to exploit targets with no ligands or experimental structure, those targets which are outside a "druggable" target family, but which have strong genetic associations.

Our target tractability is based on a modified version of [Approaches to target tractability assessment â€“ a practical perspective](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/md/c7md00633k#!divAbstract). We have been working with our partners to evaluate and validate existing tractability methods. The data that is available in our Open Targets Platform is the first step of this project: _in silico_ tractability assessment pipeline of 20,633 targets for small molecules and antibodies.
