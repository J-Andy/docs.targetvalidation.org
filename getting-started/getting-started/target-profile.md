# Target profile

When searching for a target, in addition to the list of diseases associated with it, you will also see at the top of the page the ‘View TARGET profile’ link e.g. 'View BRAF profile'. Click on the link to get information on your target of interest, outside the context of associated diseases. 

In the target profile page, you will see the target official symbol, its description and synonyms, the latter two provided by UniProt. Scroll down to see detailed information on the target \(e.g. Drugs, Protein interactions\) and the original resource of the data \(e.g. ChEMBL, OmniPath DB\):

* Drugs: [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
* Protein information: [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/)
* Pathways: [Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/)
* Similar targets \(based on diseases in common\): Open Targets Platform
* Variants, isoforms and genomic context: [Ensembl](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/opentargets/docs/edit#)
* Protein interactions: [OmniPathDB](http://omnipathdb.org)
* RNA and protein baseline expression: [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home), [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage), [Human Protein Atlas](http://www.proteinatlas.org/)
* Mouse phenotypes: [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org)
* Protein structure: [PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/)
* Gene ontology: [Gene Ontology Consortium](http://geneontology.org/) via [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/)

We also include links to the Structural Genomics Consortium when a [Target Enabling Package](http://www.thesgc.org/tep) \(or TEP\) is available, such as for the [CDK12](http://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000167258) drug target.

Finally, we incorporate details of 182 unique high-quality chemical probes for 187 different targets from the [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes) \(SGC\), the [Chemical Probes Portal](http://www.chemicalprobes.org/) and [Open Science Probes](http://www.sgc-ffm.uni-frankfurt.de/). Check the target profile page for [BRPF1](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000156983) and learn which chemical probes have been developed for this target.
