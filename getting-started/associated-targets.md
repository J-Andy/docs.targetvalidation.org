#### Targets associated with a disease

When you search for a disease, you will get to a page that shows an overview of all potential targets associated with the disease. This data is provided as a table, with cells ordered by the association score. The colour of the cells represents the strength of the association, ranging from white \(no association\) to dark blue \(strong association\). You can filter the targets by the data types supporting the association \(e.g. Genetic associations, Somatic mutations\), by pathway types containing the target \(e.g. Signal Transduction, Metabolism\) and by the class of the target associated with the disease \(e.g. Surface antigen, Secreted protein\).

You can also restrict the target displayed in the table.
