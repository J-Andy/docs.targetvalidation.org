#### The target profile

When searching for a target, in addition to the list of diseases associated with it, you will also see at the top of the page the ‘View TARGET profile’ link e.g.View BRAF profile. Click on this to get information outside the context of a disease for your target of interest. This is the list of information \(not disease related\) for a target and the original resource the data is from:
