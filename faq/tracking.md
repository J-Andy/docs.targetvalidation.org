#### Do you use the information I have searched for in Platform?

We do not analyse the nature \(e.g disease or target names\) of any specific queries via the web interface. We use standard encryption methods \(e.g. https://\) to maintain the security of the searches.

Note that some of the components of the site are provided by third parties, or make use of services provided by third parties, mostly from EMBL-EBI resources. We provide links to these external resources, and the use of their services is covered by their own terms of use. We may however use some metrics on the usage of pages and icons on the platform to improve its visualisation aspects.
