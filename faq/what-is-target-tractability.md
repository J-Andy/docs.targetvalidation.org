# What is target tractability?

Tractability of a target is the confidence that we can identify a modulator that interacts with the target to elicit a desired biological effect. 

Our definition is derived from â€œLigandability of Drug Targets: Assessment of Chemical Tractability via Experimental and In Silico Approaches" by Udo Bauer and Alexander L. Breeze.
