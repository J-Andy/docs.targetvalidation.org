# What is target tractability?

Tractability of a target is the confidence that we can identify a modulator that interacts with the target to elicit a desired biological effect. 

Our definition is derived from â€œ[Ligandability of Drug Targets: Assessment of Chemical Tractability via Experimental and In Silico Approaches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527677047.ch03)" by Udo Bauer and Alexander L. Breeze.

You can explore our tractability data in the profile page of a target, such as [APP](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000142192?view=sec:tractability), or in the associations page of a disease, such as [Alzheimer's](https://www.targetvalidation.org/disease/EFO_0000249/associations?view=t:priority&fcts=datatype:genetic_association;somatic_mutation;known_drug;affected_pathway), under the Prioritisation view. 

Head to our target tractability page for a more detailed explanation on how to use this data in drug target prioritisation.
