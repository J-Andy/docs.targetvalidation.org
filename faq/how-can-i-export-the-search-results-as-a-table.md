# How can I export the search results as a table?

You can use the Open Targets REST endpoint \`search\` to get the same results you get from the user interface: 

```text
https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/search?q=
```

By default the `search` endpoint returns the results in JSON. You can add the parameters  `&format=` and include CSV or TAB to get the same results in a table format. Note that the endpoint returns 10 results by default. If you want to download more than 10 results, letâ€™s say 100, you need to add `&size=100`.  


When searching for DMD in the Open Targets Platform, you will get [20 results](https://www.targetvalidation.org/search?src=q:dmd) \(note this number is for our 18.08 release\). If you want to download these results, you can use the following REST API call:

[https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/search?q=DMD&format=csv&size=21](https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/public/search?q=pulmonary&format=csv&size=211)

More details on our REST API can be found in our  [documentation](https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/docs/swagger-ui).

Please be aware that the results may change from release to release. So the same request against the 18.10 version will probably give different results from 18.08.
