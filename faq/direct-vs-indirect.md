#### What is the difference between direct and non-direct associations for targets and diseases?

We take into account the ontology of diseases from the Experimental Factor Ontology \(EFO\) to propagate evidence up to their parent terms. This allows us to compute new target-disease associations when there is no direct \(known and observed\) evidence for them. Read our [Direct versus indirect evidence: should you care?](http://blog.opentargets.org/direct-versus-indirect-evidence-should-you-care/) blog post for more details
