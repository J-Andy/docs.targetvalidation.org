#### How are diseases described in Open Targets?

We map diseases to ontology terms in the Experimental Factor Ontology \(EFO\). This enables us to integrate evidence from different sources and to describe relationships between diseases.

#### What is the Experimental Factor Ontology?

The[Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/)\(EFO\) provides a systematic, machine readable description of data elements available in public databases. It combines parts of several ontologies, such as diseases, phenotypes, anatomy, and chemical compounds. The EFO is the core ontology for Open Targets.

#### Why does Open Targets use EFO?

These are the reasons for choosing the Experimental Factor Ontology:

* It is an application ontology, therefore it can incorporate parts \(or the whole\) of other ontologies, such as the rare disease ontology ORDO.
* It is able to bring in additional \(not disease only\) ontologies.
* It can easily accommodate our requests for new ontology terms in addition to updates and changes, as Open Targets and the EFO team collaborate closely.
* It is the ontology of controlled vocabulary used by the GWAS catalog and the Expression Atlas. Therefore, no extra step was needed when incorporating those two data sources in our pipeline.
