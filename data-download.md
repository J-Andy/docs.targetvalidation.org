#### Can I download data from the Open Targets Platform?

Yes, you can download our data as compressed JSON files. These[file dumps are available](http://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data)for the target-disease association objects and the evidence objects, the latter used to calculate each association. Both association and evidence objects are also available programmatically via our API \(check our[API documentation](http://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/docs)\).
