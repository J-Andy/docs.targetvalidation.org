# Getting Started

The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive and robust data integration for access to and visualisation of potential drug targets associated with disease. It brings together multiple data types and aims to assist users to identify and prioritise targets for further investigation.



A drug target can be a protein, protein complex or RNA molecule and it’s displayed by its gene name from the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee, [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/). We integrate all the evidence to the target using [Ensembl stable IDs](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html) and describe relationships between diseases by mapping them to [Experimental Factor Ontology](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/) \(EFO\) terms.

The Platform supports workflows starting from a target or disease, and shows the available evidence for target – disease associations. Target and Disease profile pages showing specific information for both target \(e.g baseline expression\) and disease \(e.g. Disease Classification\) are also available.
